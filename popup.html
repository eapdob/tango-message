<textarea id="messages">Hi! I couldnâ€™t help but notice your smileâ€”itâ€™s really nice.
Hey, do we know each other? You look familiar!
Hi there! Iâ€™m trying to be more social, so I thought Iâ€™d say hello.
Excuse me, but I just had to come over and introduce myself.
Hey! I like your styleâ€”where do you usually shop?
Hi! Iâ€™m new around here. Got any fun recommendations?
Sorry if this is random, but you seem really interesting.
You look like someone who has great taste in musicâ€”what do you listen to?
Hi! This might be bold, but you seem like someone worth meeting.</textarea>
